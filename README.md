Programming Challenges
======================

This repository contains my solutions to programming challenges from several sites:

* [ICPC Live Archive](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/)
* [OIE](http://olimpiada-informatica.org/)
* [POJ (Peking University OnlineJudge)](http://poj.org/)
* [SPOJ (Sphere Online Judge)](http://www.spoj.com/)
* [UVa OnlineJudge](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/)
* [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/)

The folder 'Sample Code' includes implementations in C++ and/or Java of some common algorithms useful for contests.
